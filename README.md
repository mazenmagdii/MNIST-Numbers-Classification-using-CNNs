# MNIST-Numbers-Classification-using-CNNs
This project classifies handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The MNIST dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of digits (0-9) at 28x28 pixels. The goal is to build a CNN model that accurately classifies these digits with high precision.
